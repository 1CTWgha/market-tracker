# Market Tracker

Check it out for yourself - [Market Tracker](#)!

Market Tracker enables users to simulate playing the stock market; lookup, view, and chart stocks.  

Log in or sign up to save stocks to "Watchlist" or "Buy" stocks and save a snapshot of their current market value, then compare later to see your simulated gains (or losses).

## Why?

To demonstrate in a fun, usable way, the implementation of the MEAN stack: MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.

## User stories

* As a user, I want to search by symbol or name and find a given stock's key stats.

* As a user, I want to save stocks I'm most interested in so I can view again later in one place.

* As a user, I want to simulate buying stocks and see how they're performing so I can see how I've done.

* As a user, I want to see feature-rich charts for single and multiple stocks at once.

The Async "waterfall" function was helpful in passing data from one call to another while the "series" function also helped ensure sequencing of execution.  Lastly, the "concat" function helped improve code structure when passing over an array of urls for a given API call.
